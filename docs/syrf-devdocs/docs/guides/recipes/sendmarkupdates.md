# Send in Real Time Mark Data

You'll need to use the course information to get the mark IDs that you want to track. 
The easiest way to build a service that sends in real time streams for the marks, is to ask your users to
add your bot user as an administrator for their SYRF event. 

Once that is done, and you have GitHub access to the repositories, 
the best place to see an example
sending in real time data streams is [this repo.](https://github.com/sailing-yacht-research-foundation/live-data-server#mark-tracking-actions)
