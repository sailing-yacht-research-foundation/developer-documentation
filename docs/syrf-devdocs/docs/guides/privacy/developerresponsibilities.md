Apps that store a user's location in a database must be built by people who take this responsiblity seriously.


## Privacy

SYRF expects all partners to take privacy seriously and to uphold the relevant privacy laws for the countries in which they opperate and in which their users live.
Please note that many privacy laws apply if the end user is a citizen of a particular locale, regardless of whether or not the company is intentionally doing business there.

SYRF has the following requirements for all third party developers using our platform:

* You will be in compliance will all privacy laws governing your end users and the regions in which you do business. 
* You will be responsible for being in compliance with handling juvenile or under age users. 
* You will never sell data to a 3rd party if it was collected or accessed using the SYRF APIs or client SDKs.
* You will never attempt to datamine or target an individual using the SYRF APIs or client SDKs.

:::danger SYRF is not a law firm!
We know this is annoying, but SYRF cannot provide any advice about what does or does not constitute privacy law compliance.
:::

Any developers found to be in violation of the above will have their developer accounts suspended and API access revoked.
