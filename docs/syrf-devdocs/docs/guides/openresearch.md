# Open Research

SYRF has many open research problems and is interested in recruiting partners to help.
This is a list of problems that we've identified where our data may be helpful.
Unfortunately, we don't have the bandwidth to work on these, so if you'd like to volunteer to work on one
of these problems, and use our data, please let us know.
