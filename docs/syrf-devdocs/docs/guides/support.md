# Support

We get it - reading documentation isn't as fun as writing code.
We try our best to keep our docs up to date but inevitably things will slip through.

When you're stuck on a problem, try these resources:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/sailing-yacht-research-foundation)
    * Find the appropriate repository and look at open and closed issues.
    * Inspect the source code of our sample projects and open sourced repositories.
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/EfvufEsDua)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/syrfio)
    * Use the `#syrfio` tag.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Mskz_SpAi18XKleqhoxSg)
