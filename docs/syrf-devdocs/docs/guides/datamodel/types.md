This page describes high level types which are used across our client SDKs, REST and Websocket APIs.
Think of this page more of a dictionary than an API reference. The names, vocabulary and business logic will be similar across platforms but the specific
code that uses them will be different.

## `Participant`
A human being who sits in a vessel and goes around a course. Could be a participant with a SYRF.io account or not. Participants must be associated with `VesselParticipants` in order to track.

### Attributes
- `id`, **REQUIRED**, an identifier provided by you the developer that is unique within a `VesselParticipantGroup`. (A `VesselParticipantGroup`can't have two participants with the same id.)
- `publicName`, **REQUIRED**, a public name to be used on a map view of the race that identifies the partipant. The end-user must be aware that this will be public.
- `trackerUrl`, autogenerated, the url generated for that participant to open in SYRF tracker.

## `Vessel`
Vessels are physical objects that float on the water. They may have a crew of 1 or a crew of 30. They may be sailboats or wingfoils. The crew may change. The owner may change. The certificates and polars may change. The vessel is always the same vessel. 

### Attributes
- `id`, **REQUIRED**, an identifier provided by you the developer that is unique within a `VesselParticipantGroup`. (A `VesselParticipantGroup`can't have two participants with the same id.)
- `lengthInMeters`,  **REQUIRED**, the length in meters.
- `globalId` an optional identifier provided by the developer if they wish to track a vessel between multiple events.
- `publicName`, **REQUIRED**, a public name to be used on a map view of the race that identifies the vessel. This could be the vessel name or a team name.
- `orcJsonPolars`, an optional developer provided JSON object provided for PCS ranking within a `VesselParticipantGroup`. 
- `totValue`, a supplied ToT value to use in ToT.
- `todValue`, a supplied ToD value to use in ToD.

## `VesselParticipants`
Associates an array of human participants to a vessel for a specific `CompetitionUnit`. 

### Attributes
- `id`, **REQUIRED**, an identifier provided by you the developer that is unique within a `VesselParticipantGroup`. (A `VesselParticipantGroup`can't have two participants with the same id.)
- `vessel`, **REQUIRED**, FK on a vessel object.
- `participants`, **REQUIRED**, an array of `Participant`s who are on the vessel.

## `CalendarEvent`
A `CalendarEvent` object refers to an object that one would put on their calendar. What are colloquially called “series”, “races”, “regattas”, and “events” could all have a `CalendarEvent` object associated with them. For instance, a regatta management app may chose to use a `CalendarEvent` for a summer long series, or numerous `CalendarEvent`s for each specific Wednesday night race. A `CalendarEvent` binds a collection of CompetitionUnits. `CalendarEvent`s don’t have timestamps because they are fuzzy. Unlike a race (or `CompetitionUnit`) which has a specific start time that matters for purposes of scoring, `CalendarEvent`s have an `approximateStartTime`.

### Attributes
- `name`, **REQUIRED**, the name of the calendar event.
- `externalUrl`, the optional website for the calendar event.
-  `startDay` - autogenerated
-  `startMonth` - autogenerated
-  `startYear`- autogenerated
-  `approximateStartTime`, **REQUIRED**, the time people should gather to watch the show, be near start line, arrive at the hotel, etc.
-  `endDay` - optional but added after an event closes
-  `endMonth`  - optional but added after an event closes
-  `endYear` - optional but added after an event closes
-  `competitionUnits`, **REQUIRED**, an array of competition unit objects. Described in detail below. 


## `CompetitionUnit`
The atomic unit of a group of vessels and humans going around the same course at the same time. In order to avoid the ambiguity in terms like “race”, “regatta”, and “event” the atomic scorable object of our API is called a `CompetitionUnit`. A `CompetitionUnit` is a combination of a course, a start time and a vessel participant group.

### Attributes
- `name`, **REQUIRED**, what to call this.
- `startTime`, **REQUIRED**, Unix epoch for when the vessels should begin the course.
- `boundingBox`, **REQUIRED**, a lat/lon bounding box that defines the race area. Used for out of bounds events as well as filtering locations for privacy and getting weather data.
- `course`, **REQUIRED**, FK on Course
- `approximateStart`, **REQUIRED**, the approximate start of the competition.
- `vesselParticipantGroup`, **REQUIRED**, FK on `VesselParticipantGroup`.

## `VesselParticipantGroup`
Associates an array of `VesselParticipants` to a specific `CompetitionUnit`. 

### Attributes
- `id`, **REQUIRED**, an identifier provided by you the developer that is unique within a `VesselParticipantGroup`. (A `VesselParticipantGroup`can't have two participants with the same id.)
- `competitionUnit`, **REQUIRED**, FK on a `CompetitionUnit`.
- `vesselParticipants`, **REQUIRED**, an array of `VesselParticipants` who are engaged in the `CompetitionUnit`.


## `GroundWindObservation`
A developer supplied (maybe from an end user) observation of the wind measured from a fixed or anchored platform (the land, an anchored and settled vessel, a cemented dock, etc). The difference between this data and vessel observed data is that this data comes from user input whereas vessel observed values come from phone gps, or vessel instruments.

### Attributes
- `speedKts`, **REQUIRED**, the wind speed in kts.
- `degreesClockwiseFromTrueNorth`, the direction the wind ** comes from ** in degrees clockwise from true north.
- `degreesClockwiseFromMagneticNorth`, the direction the wind ** comes from ** in degrees clockwise from magnetic north.
- `latitude`, **REQUIRED**, the WGS84 latitude of the observation.
- `longitude`, **REQUIRED**, the WGS84 longitude of the observation.
- `altitudeAboveSeaLevelInMeters`, optional (defaults to 0), the altitude of the measurement above sea level.
- `weight`, optional, how much should this be weighted relative to other data?
- `validStartTime`, optional, when is this observation valid from?
- `validEndTime`, optional, when is this observation valid until?


## `AnchoredCurrentObservation`
A developer supplied (maybe from an end user) observation of the current measured from a fixed or anchored platform (the land, an anchored and settled vessel, a cemented dock, etc). The difference between this data and vessel observed data is that this data may come from user input whereas vessel observed values come from phone gps, or vessel instruments.

### Attributes
- `speedKts`, **REQUIRED**, the current speed in kts.
- `degreesClockwiseFromTrueNorth`, the direction the current ** is going to ** in degrees clockwise from true north.
- `degreesClockwiseFromMagneticNorth`, the direction the current ** is going to ** in degrees clockwise from magnetic north.
- `latitude`, **REQUIRED**, the WGS84 latitude of the observation.
- `longitude`, **REQUIRED**, the WGS84 longitude of the observation.
- `depth`, optional (defaults to 0), the depth of the measurement in meters below the surface.
- `weight`, optional, how much should this be weighted relative to other data?
- `validStartTime`, optional, when is this observation valid from?
- `validEndTime`, optional, when is this observation valid until?

## `Point`
A point object represents a specific point object on the planet. Point objects exist in an abstract sense and a physical sense. A point may be a mark, part of a line, or part of a polygon. A point has an idealized location as well as an actual specific location in the world for a moment in time. Point objects may represent a buoy, an obstacle, the race committee boat, or something else with a specific location. Points are the only geometry objects that are tracked, because all other geometry types are simply compositions of points.

### Attributes
- `idealizedLat` , **REQUIRED**, The idealized, fixed latitude position of this point on a map. 
- `idealizedLon`, **REQUIRED**, The idealized, fixed longitude position of this point on a map. 
- `developerId`, **REQUIRED**, A developer supplied identifier for the point.
- `trackingUrl`, autogenerated, the url to open in SYRF tracker to track that point.

## `Line`
A line is a collection of points that don’t connect. Line’s do not have a separate tracking stream from their points. A line can be a start line, finish line, or gate.

### Attributes
- `points`, **REQUIRED**, an ordered array of points (first, second, … last). Validate there are at least two points.

## `Polygon`
A polygon is a list point objects that do connect. Polygons may self intersect.

### Attributes
- `points`, **REQUIRED**, an ordered array of points. The last point is assumed to connect to the first. Validate that this is a polygon. 

## `Course`
Courses describe geometry on the surface of the Earth that `Vessels` can interact with. A course object represents a collection of sequenced, unsequenced timed geometry and unsequenced untimed geometry. SequencedGeometry is an ordered array of pairings of a geometry object with a name.
UnsequencedUntimedGeometry is a set of pairs of names and geometry that are always applied independent of an ordering. UnsequenceTimedGeometry is like UnsequencedUntimedGeometry except that each unsequenced piece of geometry has a valid start time and end time, whereas untimed geometry is valid always. For instance a course boundary may be modeled using UnseqencedUntimedGeometry.
One course may be used by many `CompetitionUnit`s, but each `CompetitionUnit` must have only one course.

### Attributes
- `id`, autogenerated, the ID of the course.
- `sequencedGeometry`, a (possibly empty) ordered array of points, lines and polygons in a specific sequence. When the start/finish line is the same, the same line object should be used twice in this array.
- `unsequencedUntimedGeometry`, a (possibly empty) set (where order is ignored) of points, lines and polygons that are always part of the course.
- `unsequencedTimedGeometry`, similar to unsequencedUntimedGeometry except that each geometry segment has a valid start and stop time. This can be used for Super Mario type coin collection for instance.

## `VesselObservedData`
A convenience type that holds a variety of data for a `VesselParticipant`. This data comes from a phone, vessel instrumentation, or is reported via our APIs by the client app.
It symbolizes data "known to be true because it was measured." Notice that some of these valuse are themselves calculated by the client app or instrumentation. For instance a vessel may have a windvane that tells the apparent wind angle as the vessel moves through the water (not the "true wind angle"). The vessel's instruments may then use internal knowledge about the vessel's speed and heading to calculate the true wind direction and report that up to us. The difference between this data type and `GroundWindObservation` and `AnchoredCurrentObservation` is that this data comes from instrumentation or platform APIs. 


### Attributes
- `vesselParticipant`, autogenerated FK on `VesselParticipant`.
- `twa`, true wind angle to the centerline of the vessel, according to the instruments. The number of degrees clockwise from the heading of the vessel that the wind is blowing from.
- `twdMagnetic`, true wind direction according to the instruments in degrees from magnetic north.
- `twsKts`, true wind speed in kts according to the instruments.
- `headingMagnetic`, the magnetic direction that the vessel is pointing in.
- `latitude`, the WGS84 latitude at time = timestampUnixMS. If lat is present, lon must be present or data should be thrown out.
- `longitude`, the WGS84 longitude at time = timestampUnixMS. If lon is present, lat must be present or data should be thrown out.
- `airPressureMB`, the air pressure in MB.
- `awa`, the apparent wind angle measured in degrees from the centerline of the vessel.
- `awsKts`, the apparent wind speed measured in kts.
- `awdMagnetic`, the apparent wind direction measured in magnetic degrees from magnetic north.
- `cogMagnetic`, course over ground from instruments.
- `sogKts`, speed over ground from instruments.
- `setDriftKts`, set and drift from instruments.
- `ellapsedTime`, how long the vessel has been racing.
- `timestampUnixMS`, **REQUIRED**, the Unix epoch timestamp that the data was collected. 


## `VesselDerivedData`
Data that has to be calculated from other data or otherwise interpolated. Much of this may be calculated by our "analysis engine" with data provided by models, or observed values or both. For instance a mobile app is not usually going to have instrument data with accurate wind information. We expect most observed value to be sent by producers, where as most derived data will be sent to consumers. 

### Attributes
- `correctedTimes`, a dictionary of corrected times where the keys are a methodology (PCS, ToD, ToT, protest) and the values are the corrected times.
- `vesselParticipant`, autogenerated FK on `VesselParticipant`.
- `twa`, true wind angle to the centerline of the vessel, according to some calculation. 
- `twdMagnetic`, true wind direction according to a model or some calculation in degrees from magnetic north.
- `twsKts`, true wind speed in kts according to a model or some calculation.
- `headingMagnetic`, the magnetic direction that the vessel is pointing in.
- `latitude`, the WGS84 latitude at time = timestampUnixMS. If lat is present, lon must be present or data should be thrown out. This may be the result of an interpolation or estimate.
- `longitude`, the WGS84 longitude at time = timestampUnixMS. If lon is present, lat must be present or data should be thrown out. This may be the result of an interpolation or estimate.
- `awa`, the apparent wind angle measured in degrees from the centerline of the vessel.
- `awsKts`, the apparent wind speed measured in kts.
- `awdMagnetic`, the apparent wind direction measured in magnetic degrees from magnetic north.
