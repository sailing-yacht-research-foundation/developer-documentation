North Sails has generously donated $100,000 in support of SYRF and SYRF technical platform.
This is exciting news and developers should be pumped! With this money, we're going to be able
to build a technical platform that makes sailing more fair, easier to understand, and less intimidating.

North has done it's part, now it's on us developers to deliver amazing apps and features.
