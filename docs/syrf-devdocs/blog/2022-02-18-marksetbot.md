SYRF is delighted to welcome MarkSetBot into the SYRF Developer Program.
Kevin Morin signaled his excitement to stream MarkSetBots locations to our
platform so that his users could view them in real time in Expedition.

We're working with MSB to help them use our Websocket APIs and hope their
early version will be ready this Spring. By the way, MarkSetBot is raising money.
